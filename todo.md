## Required
- docs

## Would be nice
- limit the number of custom error types in favour of io::Error
- support tabs in prompts and TestBackend
- when and message as functions cannot infer correct argument lifetime
  - due to hrtb
- vi bindings / custom bindings
- themes
- non-unicode terminal support
