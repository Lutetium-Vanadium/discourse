# Inquisition Examples

The examples given show some basic usage of the library in different
ways. `templates/pizza.rs` has a question iterator declaration which is
used in some examples which demonstrate things other than declaring
questions.

## Required features

Most of the examples are feature agnostic, except for `tokio`, `async-std`,
and `smol` which require enabling the feature of the same name.

## Run examples

```sh
$ cargo run --example [example-name]
```
